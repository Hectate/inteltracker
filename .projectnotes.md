# Intel found object
The issue right now is that the intel is tracked with a single true/false value for the ID, and that is all.
This is fine, but to populate the list for the runners we separately have to identify which intels are found.
Should the component look itself up in the list, will that update? Or should they just bind and show?

Lets think about how the component would look:
``<intel-icon>``
This is passed a property; that property is the intel ID. It looks itself up and decides if it should show found or not.
Intel info (not state) are stored in an object containing all the missions and some associated details.
Each mission object contains an array of intels. Those intels have a type, icon/image url, and of course the ID.
Then we just list out each mission, and within each mission list out the number of intels and their images.

Object structure is:

Missions: [
    "1": {
        index: 1
        name: "Misfortune in Morocco",
        maxIntels: XX,
        intels: [
            {
                id:1235,
                image: ....,
                type: folder,
                name: ??
            },
            {
                id:1234,
                image: ....,
                type: microfilm,
                name: ??
            }
            ...
        ]
    }
]
