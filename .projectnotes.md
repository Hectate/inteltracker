1. ~~Intel potentially duplicated (8005)~~
2. ~~Some intel is in the wrong mission~~
3. ~~Intel not sorted by scene; makes it difficult~~

6. ~~Refresh the list on boot-up, not just on first intel~~
7. ~~Clean the list if the save file is removed.~~
8. ~~Intel Groups setting to hide the 'missing' half of the group when one is found in the group~~
